# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon, small)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (toolbar icon, standard)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use the Biirbal brand colors (#1890ff blue)
- Include the "B" logo or sound wave symbol
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Use PNG format with transparent backgrounds
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, you can:
1. Use a simple favicon generator to create basic icons
2. Use placeholder icons from the Chrome samples
3. Create simple colored squares with "B" text

The extension will work without icons, but they enhance the user experience.
